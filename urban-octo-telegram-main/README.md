In order to make the Horiseon website more accesible, the first step was to annotate the images with alt text so that a page reader
is able to correctly explain the images. This step included pulling the background image out of the css file and moving it to the html
in order for alt text to be placed on it.

In addition, to make the code cleaner, redundent lines were removed from the css file by condensing them into new classes when all of their elements were the same. At this time, many of the color and font-types were moved from their individual classes to the body as only 1 font and 1 color was used for majority of the page.

NOTE: Although the correct HTML and CSS files are in the folders, I had trouble getting GitHub to create a page with them. I was able to fix this by moving the HTML and CSS out of the develop and assets folders and into the main urban-octo-telegram-main folder and then changing the necessary links.
